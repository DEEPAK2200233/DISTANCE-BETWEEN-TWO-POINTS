# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
Get the four coordinate values from the user

### Step 2:
Use import.math to assign the distance formula

### Step 3:
Substitute the values in the distance formula formula

### Step 4:
Round the value up to two decimal values and the print values it would be calculated

### Step 5:
End the program
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
l1=[10,6]
l2=[4,2]
d=math.sqrt((l2[0]-l1[0])**2+(l2[1]-l1[1])**2)
print('{:.2f}'.format(d))
```

### OUTPUT:
